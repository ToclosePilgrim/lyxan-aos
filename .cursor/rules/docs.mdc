Docs Source of Truth

- Treat **only** these folders as canonical documentation:
  - `docs/product/**`
  - `docs/architecture/**`
  - `docs/runbooks/**`

- Treat these folders as **non-canonical** (must not be used as a basis for decisions):
  - `docs/deprecated/**`
  - `docs/_archive/**`

- If a document is marked **DEPRECATED** (or lives under `docs/deprecated/`), you must not use it as a source for architecture/code changes.

- If you implement a new SCM/Inventory/Finance/Agents invariant or endpoint:
  - update `docs/architecture/SCM_FINANCE_CANON.md` with 1–3 paragraphs (or a bullet list) describing the change and the invariant it protects.
